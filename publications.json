    "description": "This research examines the barriers that prevent home tutors in Bangladesh from discussing Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) with adolescent students. Using focus group discussions guided by Communication Accommodation Theory, the study identifies key cultural, interpersonal, and professional challenges influencing tutors’ communication practices. The findings reveal that societal conservatism, censorship, and fear of job insecurity lead tutors to avoid sexuality-related topics. The paper emphasizes the need for targeted training, resources, and institutional support to empower tutors and promote effective sexuality education among adolescents.",
